                <p> Climate is sometimes mistaken for weather. But climate is different from weather because it is measured over a long period of time, whereas weather can change from day to day, or from year to year. The climate of an area includes seasonal temperature and rainfall averages, and wind patterns. Different places have different climates. A desert, for example, is referred to as an arid climate because little water falls, as rain or snow, during the year. Other types of climate include tropical climates, which are hot and humid, and temperate climates, which have warm summers and cooler winters. </p>
              

                <p>The cause of current climate change is largely human activity, like burning fossil fuels, like natural gas, oil, and coal. Burning these materials releases what are called greenhouse gases into Earth’s atmosphere. There, these gases trap heat from the sun’s rays inside the atmosphere causing Earth’s average temperature to rise. This rise in the planet's temperature is called global warming. The warming of the planet impacts local and regional climates. Throughout Earth's history, climate has continually changed. When occuring naturally, this is a slow process that has taken place over hundreds and thousands of years. The human influenced climate change that is happening now is occuring at a much faster rate.</p>

            <h3>Amzaon deforestation and climate change</h3>
            <p>
                High on a tower overlooking the lush Amazon canopy, Gisele Bundchen and Brazilian climate scientist Antonio Nobre talk about the importance of the rain forest and the impact of cutting down its trees.

                As Nobre explains, the rainforest is not only home to an incredible diversity of species, it also has a critical cooling effect on the planet because its trees channel heat high into the atmosphere. In addition, forests absorb and store carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere—CO2 that is released back into the atmosphere when trees are cut and burned.

            <p>The Amazon rain forest absorbs one-fourth of the CO2 absorbed by all the land on Earth. The amount absorbed today, however, is 30% less than it was in the 1990s because of deforestation. A major motive for deforestation is cattle ranching. China, the United States, and other countries have created a consumer demand for beef, so clearing land for cattle ranching can be profitable—even if it’s illegal. The demand for pastureland, as well as cropland for food such as soybeans, makes it difficult to protect forest resources.
            
            Brazil continues to make impressive strides in reducing its impact on climate change. In the past two decades, its CO2 emissions have dropped more than any other country. Destruction of the rain forest in Brazil has decreased from about 19,943 square kilometers (7,700 square miles) per year in the late 1990s to about 5,180 square kilometers (2,000 square miles) per year now. Moving forward, the major challenge will be fighting illegal deforestation.

            <p>
                In this video, Don Cheadle takes an aerial tour of one of California’s drought-stricken landscapes—a disappearing reservoir called Folsom Lake. Flying with him is Felicia Marcus, the top water official for the American state, who explains that four years of drought and no snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains have severely depleted the reservoir, one of the state’s main water supplies.

                “This is absolutely what our future looks like under climate change,” Marcus states.

            <p>
                In 2016, California took the lead among U.S. states in addressing climate change by extending legislation to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Targeting both power plants and vehicles, the state committed to the goal of curbing carbon emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. Laws passed in 2006 had already set targets to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.
                California, and most western U.S. states, rely heavily on snowpack each winter to resupply surface water streams and lakes. Lack of winter storms and warmer temperatures results in low snowmelt levels and depleted water supplies.

            <h3>Ocean Impacts of Climate Change</h3>
            <p>
                Travel to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef with Joshua Jackson, and witness the beauty of a fragile reef ecosystem that could be lost if people continue to release carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere at current levels.

                In a conversation with a University of Queensland marine biologist, Jackson learns how science has only recently connected climate change with ocean acidification. The ocean absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere and the CO2 reacts with seawater, increasing the ocean’s acidity. Higher acidity is harmful to coral and other marine life. Though humans have assumed that our vast ocean is an inexhaustible resource, it appears the ocean’s resilience is reaching its limit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although coral reefs make up less than one percent of the ocean floor, they support 25 percent of all marine species.

                Human activity that adds CO2 to the atmosphere also warms the oceans, which can cause coral bleaching. When the water is too warm, coral releases the algae that give it its color. The coral then turns white and often dies.

                Most coral reefs grow in tropical waters. The largest coral reef is the Great Barrier Reef, one of the “Seven Natural Wonders of the World,” which extends more than 1,930 kilometers (1,200 miles) off the eastern coast of Australia.

                The continental United States has one barrier reef, the Florida Reef, stretching about 555 kilometers (345 miles) from Palm Beach to beyond Key West. The Florida Reef is important to the local and state economy, generating about $6.3 billion annually in tourism.

            <h3>Changing Climate and the Maya</h3>
            <p>Ancient Maya civilization thrived thousands of years ago in present-day Central America. Anthropologists and archaeologists thought Maya culture originated in the northern reaches of what is now Guatemala about 600 B.C.E., and migrated north to the Yucatan Peninsula beginning around 700 C.E.
            
            Throughout the film Quest for the Lost Maya, a team of anthropologists led by Dr. George Bey discovers the Maya may have been in the Yucatan as far back as 500 B.C.E. This new evidence indicates the Maya of the Yucatan had a very complex social structure, distinctive religious practices, and unique technological innovations that made civilization possible in the harsh jungle.

            </video>
            <p>Archaeologists have long puzzled over the collapse of Mayan civilization. What led to the massive depopulation of major Maya cities in the 900s? Scientists have considered war and political factors, but this segment of Quest for the Lost Maya suggests another explanation.
            In a University of Florida lab, Dr. Mark Brenner evaluates sediment cores that have produced new data that suggests climate—specifically, severe drought—played a key role in the decline of ancient Maya civilization. This segment of Quest for the Lost Maya outlines how scientists use snail shells and sediment layers from the bottom of a lake to create a picture of climate conditions at various periods in the ancient past.

            <p>
                The science is clear: We must cut carbon pollution and other greenhouse gas emissions by at least half—in this decade—to avert a climate catastrophe. With this imperative in mind, we must remain laser-focused on a rapid transition to 100 percent clean energy in the United States by 2035, and similarly ambitious goals in other climate-critical countries. The solutions are already there: Renewables are becoming less expensive and more reliable than fossil fuels, and energy efficiency has proven itself the most reliable, abundant, and cost-effective form of energy security. We must spur investment in these solutions at every level, and help guide the way to a world that is healthier, safer, and more just.

                As part of comprehensive Heat Action Plans to cope with increasingly scorching conditions, the Indian cities of Ahmedabad and Hyderabad have made energy-efficient and climate-friendly cool roofs mandatory for all municipal, commercial, and government buildings and prioritized them for low-income housing. Cool roofs are made from simple materials (such as solar-reflective paint) and can help keep a home’s temperature lower by some seven to nine degrees Fahrenheit during the summer.

                At a 2021 United Nations General Assembly meeting, President Xi Jinping announced that “China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad.”
                
                Illinois is implementing its newly passed Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), one of the most comprehensive pieces of climate legislation in the country’s history and a blueprint for other states to follow. CEJA puts a focus on workers and equity and mandates carbon-free power by 2045, making it the first state in the Midwest to completely phase out fossil fuels and one of only eight states to do so nationwide. It will grow renewable energy generation more than fivefold while closing all remaining coal plants, including Prairie State Energy Campus, one of the nation’s top polluters.

            <p>
                For the zero-waste system to make the greatest impact, it needs to work for everyone—on scales both large and small. Unfortunately, it’s often perceived as a lifestyle choice for those who have the time and money to invest in the right habits and products.

                The reality is there are communities of all sizes and economic profiles around the world that have adopted zero-waste approaches in the fight against climate change.

                From rural villages to entire countries, each has its own motivations and unique solutions to zero waste —illustrating the fact that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to sustainability, and anyone can work to improve waste disposal and conserve natural resources while simultaneously reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

                So, from New York to New Delhi,  from the Baltic Sea to Boulder County, here, we look at the progress of diverse communities around the world that prove how the zero-waste movement is making waves in so many places.

            <p>Governments, businesses and civil society are connecting in climate initiatives to speed up the pace of climate action. Initiated at the 2019 Climate Action Summit held at the United Nations, the initiatives below are reducing emissions, tackling critical concerns such as jobs and gender equality, unlocking finance, building sustainable infrastructure, using nature-based solutions, and advancing adaptation and climate resilience.

                The United Nations’ role as a convener is needed more than ever to encourage all sectors to collaborate, be ambitious and take actions required to tackle the climate crisis and  transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy that is just and beneficial for all people.
                
                To showcase positive leadership by governments, business, finance, local authorities and civil society, the UN Secretary-General is convening a Climate Ambition Summit in September 2023.

It hinges on protecting at least 30 per cent of the planet by 2030, backed by sufficient financial resources and the full realization of indigenous leadership and rights.

            Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance: ORRAA connects governments, financial institutions, the insurance industry, environmental organizations and actors from the Global South to build resilience to ocean risk. It pioneers finance and insurance products aimed at incentivizing $500 million in investment in nature-based solutions by 2030.</p>
        
        <h3>The Paris Agreement</h3>
        <p>
            To tackle climate change and its negative impacts, world leaders at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris reached a breakthrough on 12 December 2015: the historic Paris Agreement.

            The Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations to:
            <ul>
                <li>substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to hold global temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change</li>
                <li>periodically assess the collective progress towards achieving the purpose of this agreement and its long-term goals</li>
                <li>provide financing to developing countries to mitigate climate change, strengthen resilience and enhance abilities to adapt to climate impacts.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2023, the first “global stocktake” will assess progress on Paris Agreement goals and chart a way forward. This process, to be concluded at COP28, will further encourage countries to take ambitious climate actions that keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.  
        </p>

        <h3>COP28: Climate action can’t wait</h3>
        <p>
            With global temperatures hitting record highs, and extreme weather events affecting people around the globe, this year’s UN climate change conference, COP28, is a pivotal opportunity to correct course and accelerate action to tackle the climate crisis. COP28 is where the world will take stock of progress on the Paris Agreement – the landmark climate treaty concluded in 2015 – and chart a course of action to dramatically reduce emissions and protect lives and livelihoods.

            The science is clear: to preserve a livable climate, the production of coal, oil, and gas must rapidly decline, and global renewable power capacity – including wind, solar, hydro and geothermal energy – needs to triple by 2030. At the same time, financing for adaptation and investments in climate resilience need a quantum leap.
            
            COP28 brings together leaders from governments, businesses, NGOs and civil society to find concrete solutions to the defining issue of our time.
